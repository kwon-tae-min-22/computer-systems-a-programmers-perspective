This repository contains my notes and code examples from the book "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective" by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron. The book provides a comprehensive introduction to computer systems from a programmer's perspective, covering topics such as data representation, machine-level programming, memory hierarchy, and system-level I/O.
